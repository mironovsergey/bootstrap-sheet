- Add JSDoc comments for all public methods
- Keep functions small and focused

```javascript
/**
 * Shows the sheet with animation
 * @fires show.bs.sheet
 * @returns {void}
 */
show() {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### Sass/CSS

- Follow BEM naming convention for new classes
- Use Sass variables for customizable values
- Keep specificity low
- Mobile-first approach

```scss
.sheet {
  &__header {
    // Header styles
  }

  &--large {
    // Modifier styles
  }
}
```
